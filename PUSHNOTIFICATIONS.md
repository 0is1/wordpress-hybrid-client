- **Android**: If you have not already done so, you'll need to set up a Google API project, to generate your senderID. [Follow these steps](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/gs.html) to do so. This is described more fully in the **Testing** section below. In this example, be sure and substitute your own senderID. Get your senderID by signing into to your [google dashboard](https://code.google.com/apis/console/). The senderID is found at *Overview->Dashboard->Project Number*.
